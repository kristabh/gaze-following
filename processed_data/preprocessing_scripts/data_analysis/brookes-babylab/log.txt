There is a possible issue with the stimulus presentation for the participants
in 'Order 2'. That is, there is no videoname named: 'Ord2_T6_L.avi', trial 6
for these participants is called: 'Ord3_T6_L.avi', is this because they saw this
video? Or did the naming go wrong?

-----------------------

Participants with little to no data:

"G120"
"G133"
"G147"
"G22"
"G25"
"G33"
"G42"
"G44"
"G45"
"G48"
"G54"

No dependent variables could be classified for these participants

AOIs
The provided left and right offset (0 pixels) in the eyetracking details file 
can only be correct if the video was streched over the x-axis, since this seems
unlikely (also given the raw data) the offset is reset to 190 pixels. Is this correct?
