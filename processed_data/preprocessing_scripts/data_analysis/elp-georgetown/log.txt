The xlsx data wouldn't read into R, therefore I saved the xlsx file as txt
and use that file for the analysis.

The samplerate is set at 120 instead of the 300 mentioned in the eye-tracking
detail file. I assume this is correct?

There are 3 participants that are duplicates. That is, their id's appear two
times in the data. These are the id's:

8735 
8874 
8938

For now I decided to exclude these participants, but I wonder what happened here
and how we should handle this?

The provided left and right offset (226 pixels) in the eyetracking details file 
can only be correct if the video was streched over the x-axis, since this seems
unlikely the offset is reset to 285 pixels. Is this correct?
