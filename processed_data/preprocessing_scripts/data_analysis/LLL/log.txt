The duration of the trials is different for some of the video's
These video's have a duration of 10.5 seconds, instead of 10 seconds:

"Ord1_T4_RX.xvd" "Ord2_T1_LX.xvd" "Ord2_T2_RX.xvd" "Ord2_T6_LX.xvd" "Ord3_T1_LX.xvd" "Ord4_T2_LX.xvd"

Is this correct? How does this affect the timing of the head turn in the video?

AOIs
According to the screen dimension 1024x768 and offset (0,0,0,0) the video were streched
was this indeed the case? Otherwise the AOI should be adjusted
